# Code of Conduct

This project is governed by two simple axioms of human interaction:

* Don't *try* to offend people. If it is brought to your attention that you
  have offended someone then apologize sincerely.

* Don't *try* to be offended by people. If you are offended by someone bring it
  to their attention and then accept their sincere apology.

Any situation not resolved by adhering to these two axioms should be brought to
the attention of the project maintainers who will provide mediation and take
corrective action at their discretion.
