# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. It means that you not
only find it find it useful, but that you think there's something that could be
done to make it more useful, or useful to more people. Any suggestions are
welcome, including open discussion about the direction of the project as a
whole.

That being said, the current vision is to be a stock Gnome project, although
not necessarily *pure* Gnome. For example, there are no plans to include
integration for file managers other that Nautilus, however contributions for
other file managers would be accepted so long as inclusion doesn't *require*
dependencies that wouldn't normally be found in a stock Gnome desktop.
Additionally, all code should be written in [GJS][gjs] if at all possible.

The best way to get in touch is either by [opening a new issue][issue] or by
contacting one of the current [Contributors][contributors] directly.
