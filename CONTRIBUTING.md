# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project. It means that you not
only find it useful, but that you think there's something that could be done to
make it more useful, or useful to more people. *Any* suggestions are welcome,
including open discussion about the direction of the project as a whole. Don't
worry if you can't code, can't document, can't design graphics, can't translate
or have trouble with english; I still want to hear from you.

That being said, the current vision is to be a stock Gnome project, although
not necessarily *pure* Gnome. For example, there are no plans to include
integration for file managers other that Nautilus, however contributions for
other file managers would be accepted so long as including them doesn't *force*
other users to install dependencies that they don't need or wouldn't normally
be found in a stock Gnome desktop.

Additionally, all code should be written in [GJS][gjs] if at all possible and
should not be written in compiled languages that are architecture dependent. As
long as it can be unpacked from a ZIP and ready to go for everyone, that's good
enough.

The best way to get in touch is either by [opening a new issue][issue] or by
contacting one of the current [contributors][contributors] directly.
